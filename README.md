# making Soar work with Unity
 making the SOAR 9.6.1 cogninitve architecture work with Unity 2021.3.14.f1

Basically creating a DLL to interact with Soar directly using C++ works. Notice that inside Unity the Soar's and your's DLLs must be in the same folder. <\br> 

A decent tutorial will be provided here as soon as I have a better understanding about using Soar and making it intaract with Unity.
